## Description
In this game, the player travels a star map that is randomly populated with planets of differing trade classifications, buys and sells goods, while maintaining a positive credit balance and a non-empty fuel tank.

## User Stories

* As a player I would like to see a list of randomly generated planets with trade specialties, population type, and trade goods that are available for sale.
* As a player I would like to see a list of nearby planets that I can travel to this turn.
* As a player I am presented with a list of trade goods for sale on the planet I'm on with its sale price.
* As a player I am presented with the sale price (that Planet's Market Value) of the goods I have on my ship.
* As a player I can sell all of a trade good I have on my ship.
* As a player my fuel gauge is reduced by 10 units per square traveled.
* My ship initially has 50 units of fuel.
* As a player, each turn deducts X amount of credits from my balance as operating costs.
* Fuel can only be purchased at Fueling Stations which are randomly generated on the map of Planets.
* As a player the maximum amount of trade good I can purchase is limited by (a) market supply, (b) cargo capacity, and (c) my credit balance.
